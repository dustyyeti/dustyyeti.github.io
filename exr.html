<b>Ecstatic [X]Reality: Mediating Altered States of Consciousness</b><br><br>
Abstract<br><br>
The practice of ecstatic ritual is as ancient as human culture. With the rise of organizedreligion and the rational scientific revolutions, knowledge of practices and techniques fadedinto myth. Ecstasy can be described as a highly charged emotional state, at once volatile anddeeply significant, presenting the conscious mind with inexplicable mental visions. ContemporaryWestern culture eschews the value of ecstatic ritual, in favor of rational problem-solving. Theecstatic experience is personal, unfathomable, and the only detailed signs of its passage are in theaccounts of subjects relating their experiences. The ephemeral subjectivity of ecstasy presentsnumerous barriers for the formal investigation of the transformation of consciousness, in bothscientific credo and societal acceptance.

A person may use non-invasive mental techniques of meditation, prayer, trance, and thelike, to achieve an ecstatic state of mind. Ingesting psychoactive compounds can also lead toecstasy. Until the 20thcentury, these processes have been primarily held to be the domain ofspiritual exploration. With parallel advances of both inorganic and organic chemistry, scientistsdiscovered psychoactive chemicals inherent in plants reacted in the brain in unforeseen ways.Further exploration of natural compounds and fully human-made laboratory chemicals revealedthe existence of neurotransmitters, demonstrating that the experience of consciousness can bedirected by temporarily altering brain neurochemistry.

The ecstatic experience relates to a state of perception of self in a world of sensation. It isconceivable that that deviation from ordinary frames of reference, as shown by the recordings inthe stories of shamans, religious practitioners, yogis, and scientific experimentation, is central tothe benefits inherited from an altered state of mind. Evidence has shown that ecstatic ritualwell-conceived can have lasting therapeutic effects for mood disorders, assist in overcomingchemical addictions, and enhance overall peace of mind.

Accepting that ecstasy is a personal voyage wherein the individual reimagines itself in analtered world, is it also possible to direct the development of strictly external sensations to assistin the development of similar outcomes? This paper will explore the use ofCross Reality(XR) to craft uniquely adapted ecstatic experiences. Accessing ecstasy withEcstatic Cross Reality(EXR)offers hitherto unreachable features of altered state consciousness. Chief among them is theopportunity to be observed by third partiesâ€”which is to say, empirical, and to some degree,reproducible.EXRcan be simultaneously a door to spiritual discovery, and a research tool intothe workings of the conscious mind.
